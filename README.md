What did the fish say when he posted bail? "I'm off the hook!" 

How did the fish find the World Wide Web? In a Net.

This is fishy...

Some times, at the end of an experiment, we learn something. This is not one of those times.

If only, if only the fish swam

I always lose in go-fish. It's usually because I'm slow at responding.

The fish said "let me tell you a tale...". It was over before it started. FIN.
"You stink" said the crowd. Little did they know, this fish didn't have a nose. He lost it in a fight with a bottle nose dolphin. He was good with the blade.

Things escalated quickly...
